              What is your long term goal or career pathway?
              <br>

            </p>
                <p class="response">
                  My long term goal is to be able to work remotely and to have the flexibility to possibly work and travel, whilst consistently learning and growing. Another goal of mine is to represent Maori and Pasefika Women in the tech industry. However, in regards to a pathway, I have thought about possibly dabbling with design as well and either look into UX design or possibly even graphic design. I believe that one of these additional skills will add another cool skill to my belt.

    <p class="blogquestion">
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </p>

     <p class="response">
      Time Management. I get so caught up with so many ideas that sometimes I tend to get distracted and fixate on a certain task and complete that as best as I can but then I run out of time for the other tasks and then I end up popping in “overtime” to get things complete. So, Time Management with a dash of problem solving.

     <p class="blogquestion">
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
      <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
      <br>
      <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you </li>


     </p>
    <br>
     <p class="response">
      When things are getting overwhelming, I tend to: 
      <li>Take a Break </li>
      <li>Write out or jot down all the things that are frustrating me or building up</li>
      <li>them all down and see what I can do to complete them </li>
      <li>Prioritize them out to get a clear idea of what needs to be done </li>
      <li>Talk it out with someone close to me, just to offload</li>
      <li>Then start on the list refreshed</li>

    <br>
    <p class="response">
    I don’t have any specific expectations. I am going into this ready to learn and with an open-mind. The main thing would be support and transparency. I would like reassurance that I am on the correct path or not and If something is wrong for them to be straight up and advise the gap or the concern.
