      <h6 class="blogquestion"> Mental Blocks </h6>
        <p class="response"> <u>SO MANY TIMES.</u>
          <br>
          <br>
          In this sprint there were heaps of times that I was "blocked" because I was still a little unsure on how to use some of the functions, comprehension and the fact that the <strong>"math was not mathing."</strong>.
          <br>
    
          <br>
           Because I am a beginner to coding, this sprint was definitely a challenge. However, by some miracle of trial and error, research, console.logging, mental breaks away from my laptop and of course google, I completed the Kata Tasks and made it through the week.<br><br>
          &#127881;
          <br>
          <br>
          However, I found that when I would eventually find the solution to my headache - it was because I had either forgotten a comma, space between a bracket or forgot an "s" on a word that was meant to be plural. 
          Grammer & spelling is really important. It led me to a lot of "ah huh" moments and "oh duh" moments.  
          </p> 


          <h6 class="blogquestion"> Elegantly Solved ? &#128517;</h6>
          <p class="response">
            <em>Elegantly solved? </em> I don't think I solved these problems elegantly. But they got solved. But, honestly with the multiple different techniques that have been presented, solutions were found. &#128517;
            <br>
            An example: 
            <ul>
              <li><strong> Youtube & Google:</strong> If there was something I was stuck on I would search it on google. However, I did find that a few forums were confusing - it was hard to find simplified terminology - Luckily, a few youtube creators came through clutch, with visuals and simplified explanations. </li>
              <br>
            
          </p>

      <h6 class="blogquestion"> Problem Solving Techniques </h6>
      <p class="response">
        Personally, I like Trial and Error as a method, but it isn't always practical for time crunching situations. <br> <br>
        However, throughout this sprint have discovered new methods and rediscovered some important ones.
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rubber Ducky Method</li>
          <li>Pseudocode</li>
          <li>Console.logging</li>
          <li>Google</li>
          </ul> 
          <br>  
          <br>
        
      <h6 class="blogquestion"> Confidence Level for Technique Capabilities </h6>

      <h6 class="starstitle"> &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#x2606;	
	
      </h6>
      <p class="response"> At the moment my confidence for the above techniques are sitting at a 3.5/5 star rating. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Pseudo is great but sometimes it takes me a little while to break down the problem into smaller blocks and to comprehend what the actual task at hand is and what it is asking me to do. However, I found that using pseudo in conjunction with console.log to see if it was doing what it was what I wanted to do. 
        <br>
        <br>
        One thing that I will definitely be looking at <strong> improving</strong> is <em>asking for help</em>. I need to be more confident in asking for help from my peers.
