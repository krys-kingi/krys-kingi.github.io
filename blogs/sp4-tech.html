      <h6 class="blogquestion"> Mental Blocks </h6>
        <p class="response"> SO MANY TIMES.
          <br>
          <br>
          In this sprint there were heaps of times that I was "blocked" because I was still a little unsure on how to use some of the functions, comprehension and the fact that the "math was not mathing in my mind".
          <br>
          <br>
           Because I am a beginner to coding, this sprint was definitely a challenge. However, by some miracle of trial and error, research, console.logging, mental breaks away from my laptop and of course google, I completed the Kata Tasks and made it through the week. &#127881;

          <h6 class="blogquestion"> Elegantly Solved ?</h6>
          <p class="response">
            Elegantly solved? I don't think I solved these problems elegantly. But they got solved. But, honestly with the multiple different techniques that have been presented, solutions were found. &#128517;

          </p>



      <h6 class="blogquestion"> Problem Solving Techniques </h6>
      <p class="response">
        Personally, I love Trial and Error as a method, but it isn't always practical for time crunching situations. <br> <br>
        However, throughout this sprint have discovered new methods and rediscovered some important ones.
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rubber Ducky Method</li>
          <li>Pseudocode</li>
          <li><strong>Asking for Help</strong></li>
          <li>Console.logging</li>
          <li>Google</li>
          </ul> 
            
          <br>
        
      <h6 class="blogquestion"> Confidence Level for Technique Capabilities </h6>

      <h6 class="starstitle"> &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</h6>
      <p class="response"> At the moment my confidence for the above techniques are sitting at a 4/5 star rating. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes it takes me a little while to break down the problem into smaller blocks and to comprehend what the actual task at hand is and what it is asking me to do.
