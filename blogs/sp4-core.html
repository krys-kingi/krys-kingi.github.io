        <h6 class="blogquestion"> Discuss
        how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people. 
        </h6>
           <p class="response">
            Neuroplasticity describes the way the brain can change and adapt, as a result of experience. There are many benefits to neuroplasticity. If you take the time to allow your brain to adapt and change, this can help promote:
     <ul>
      <li>The ability to learn new things. </li>
      <li>The ability to enhance existing cognitive capabilities </li>
      <li>Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries</li>
      <li>Strengthening areas where function is lost or has declined</li> </ul>
          <br>

      <h6 class="blogquestion">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit. </h6>
        <p class="response">
        For me, It would be practice, practice, practice. Repitition will help build the connections. Our neuroplasticity allows us to adapt to our actions regardless of how old we are. Its amazing how our brain can be influenced because it's so maluable.
      
      <h6 class="blogquestion"> What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity? </h6>
       <p class="response">
        There are heaps of ways, some are:
        <ul>
          <li>Brain training websites, apps, and programs</li>
          <li>Healthy Diet - Brain Foods</li>
          <li>Being present and enjoying the moment as well as being fully engaged in any task that is being completed</li>
          <li>Mindfulness and meditation</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
    <h6 class="blogquestion"> Growth Mindset </h6>

      <p class="response"> 
        A growth mindset is the belief that your abilities, such as intelligence or creativity, are malleable traits that we can develop. Whilst a fixed mindset is the belief that "it is what it is" and will just believe that they are restricted intellectually.
        <br>
        Exploring this has really helped me. Leading up to my journey at EDA I was a go with the flow person(still kind of am) and a "it is what it is" person. <br>
        I have realised that that so many things can be achieved when you have a growth mindset and when you are able to change habits and have goals, you are capable of so many things.
